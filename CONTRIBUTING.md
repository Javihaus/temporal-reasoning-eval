## Code Release Philosophy

We release our experimental notebooks as research artifacts 
documenting the actual research process, not as production 
software. The notebooks contain:


- Interactive workflow reflecting Google Colab constraints
- Manual memory management for sequential model testing
- Conversational commentary documenting experimental reasoning
- Embedded test scenarios and training data generation



This transparency serves two purposes:


1. Reproducibility: Researchers can see exactly what we 
   did, including the messy parts often hidden in polished 
   releases
2. Practical guidance: Independent researchers working 
   with similar constraints can adapt our actual workflow 
   rather than reverse-engineering from idealized code


The notebooks are not polished evaluation frameworks. They are 
honest documentation of empirical research conducted with 
limited computational resources. We believe this transparency 
better serves the research community.
